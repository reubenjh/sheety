Sadly didn't finish! Here's a writeup on next steps and my approach to them if I had had time...

*** Add formatting features: bold, italic, underline
    - I would have added these options as buttons alongside the refresh button in the DOM
    - Move all three buttons up above the sheet in the UI as it would look nicer there I think
    - Add event listener functions to the buttons that do the following
        - Change the UI in some way to show you're now in formatting mode, and to show which button is active
        - Add a click event to the document that does the following
            - Checks target to see if it's a Cell (potentially using js 'instanceof' operator) & not a Label
                - If yes, check cell if it has already been styled, so it can appropriately toggle style off if this is a subsequent click
                - Apply style (CSS)
            - Removes it's own click event
        - Remove UI changes to show you're no longer in formatting mode
    - I would then probably refactor the buttons to be classes for readability, making the refresh button a class too in the process.
*** Fix bug with SUM functions where they don't seem to be able to accomodate including another SUM'd cell in their range
*** Add logic to remove redundant 'changed' Cell event listeners as they can build up
*** Add more complex functions like AVERAGE, COUNT etc
*** Cry that I didn't put enough thought into building it in a table structure from the get go...
